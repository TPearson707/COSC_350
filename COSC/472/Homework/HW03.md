concatenate v and k to get key

    * a
        - srip 80 bits from b
        - concatenate key
        - Apply RC4
        - then XOR C 
        - we get m = plaintext
        - RC4 (v||k) XOR C = m
    * b
        - message sent by v concatenated with c (v||c)
        - if the 80 bits appear
        - they know the same key stream has been used
